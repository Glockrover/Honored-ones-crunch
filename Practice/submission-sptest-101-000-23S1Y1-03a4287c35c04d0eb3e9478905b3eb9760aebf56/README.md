# Problems - ID Number decoder

* Modify `functions.py` to solve the problem as stated in [_TODO_ ref to content's problem description].
* The skeleton code needs to be fixed before the tests run.
* You can run the program using the instructions in *To Run* below.
* You can test technical correctness by running the unit tests as in the section *To Test* below.

### To Run

* `python3 main.py`
* Follow the prompt and enter a valid ID number or 'quit' to close the program

### To Test

* To run all the unittests: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_functions.py`
* To run a specific step's unittest, e.g step *1*: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_functions.TestFunctions.test_get_date_of_birth`
* _Note_: at the minimum, these (*unedited*) tests must succeed before you may submit the solution for review.
